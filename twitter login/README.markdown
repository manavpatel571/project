**Selenium Twitter Login**

This project demonstrates how to use Selenium WebDriver with Python to
automate Twitter login process. The code opens a Firefox browser window,
navigates to the Twitter login page, fills out the username and password
fields, and clicks the login button.

**Prerequisites**

-   Python 3.x

-   Selenium WebDriver for Firefox

-   geckodriver executable file (for Firefox)

-   Twitter account credentials

**Installation**

1.  Install Python from the official website:
    [[https://www.python.org/downloads/]{.underline}](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2.  Install Selenium WebDriver for Firefox by running pip install
    selenium command in the terminal.

3.  Download geckodriver executable file from Mozilla\'s website:
    [[https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases]{.underline}](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases)

4.  Place the geckodriver executable file in a directory accessible by
    your Python environment (e.g. add the directory to your system\'s
    PATH variable).

5.  Clone or download this repository.

**Usage**

1.  Open the login_twitter.py file in a text editor.

2.  Replace \"write your username\" and \"write your password\" strings
    in the code with your Twitter account credentials.

3.  Save and close the file.

4.  Open the terminal and navigate to the directory where the
    login_twitter.py file is located.

5.  Run the python login_twitter.py command in the terminal.

6.  Wait for the code to execute and the Firefox window to open and
    navigate to the Twitter login page.

7.  The code will fill out the username and password fields and click
    the login button automatically.

8.  Once the login is successful, the Firefox window will close
    automatically.
